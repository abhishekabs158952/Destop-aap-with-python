# Destop-aap-with-python
# Code in final.py
# Input CSV File name = Mappedsku.csv
# Output CSV File name = csv_example6
# no. of rows in output has increased because their is no match(dimension) in Distributor Item code and Company Dscription
(Their is some item in company dscription which have dimension d and that dimension not present in Distributor Item code and vise-versa 
so the no. of rows having such condition has doubles(not repeated just divided into two rows) thats why no. of row has been increased in output)
